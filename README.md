# Black_Litterman_with_AI_view

<p> Black-Litterman model is widely used by institutional investors since it was intro- duced by Black and Litterman of Goldman Sachs in 1992. Investor’s view is the main feature that distinguish the Black-Litterman model with modern portfolio the- ory. Black-Litterman model uses a Bayesian approach to combine the subjective views of an investor with the market equilibrium vector of expected returns to form a new es- timate of expected returns. This paper provides an application of the Black-Litterman model for portfolio management. The novel feature of this paper related to the extent literature on Black-Litterman methodology is that we use artificial intelligence method to obtain views as the proxies of investor’s view in Black-Litterman model.</p>

<p> Views were derived by using ANN and RNN.</p>
